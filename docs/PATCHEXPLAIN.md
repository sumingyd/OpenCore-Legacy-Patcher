# Explaining the patches in OpenCore Legacy Patcher

In our patcher, there are numerous patches used to ensure a stable system. Here we're going to go over what patches are used and why we recommend or even require them.

* [OpenCore Settings](#opencore-settings)
* [Injected Kexts](#injected-kexts)
* [On-Disk Patches](#on-disk-patches)

## OpenCore Settings

Below is a run down of the main logic OpenCore Legacy Patcher uses to gain native support in macOS. Note that OpenCore's configuration is documented within [OpenCorePkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) as well as on an online version provided by us:
